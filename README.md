# ublue-image
A familiar(ish) Ubuntu desktop for Fedora Silverblue 

This is a containerized version of [ublue](https://ublue.it) utilizing the latest image based features in ostree. 

WARNING: This is experimental and not tested that much, but my goal is to provide the experience I want with as much automation as possible.
